# RippleEffect: Hydrate Detection System

## ðŸŒŸ Inspiration

Our project was driven by the critical need for energy optimization and conservation in oil production systems. We chose this challenge at HackUTD because:

1. It addresses real-world energy efficiency challenges in oil production
2. It aligned well with our team's expertise and could be reasonably accomplished within the hackathon's time constraints
3. It offered an opportunity to work with real-time data and create immediate impact

## ðŸŽ¯ What it does

Hydrate Detection is a system designed to detect hydrate formation in oil well gas injection systems. The system monitors:

- Current gas injection volume
- Target gas injection volume
- Valve open percentage

When hydrate formation is detected, the system alerts operators via email, allowing for swift action to prevent production losses and potential well shutdowns.
